\section{Overview}

Like the algorithms for others elementary functions, we will compute
our hyperbolic cosine and sine in one or two steps.  The first one,
which is called 'fast step' is always executed and provides a
precision of about 63 bits.  This is a sufficient precision in most
cases, but sometimes more precision is needed, and then we enter the
second step (called `slow pass') using the SCS library.


\subsubsection*{Definition interval and exceptional cases}
The hyperbolic cosine and the hyperbolic sine are defined for all real
numbers, and then for all floating point numbers.  These functions are
divergent toward $+\infty$ and $-\infty$, so for $|x| > 710.47586007$,
$\cosh(x)$ and $\sinh(x)$ should return $+\infty$ or the greatest
representable number (depending ot the choosen rounding mode).

\begin{itemize}
\item If $x = NaN$ , then $\sin(x)$ and $\cosh(x)$ should return $NaN$
\item If $x = +\infty$ , then $\cosh(x)$ and $\sinh(x)$ should return $+\infty$. 
\item If $x = -\infty$ , then $\cosh(x)$ should return $+\infty$. 
\item If $x = -\infty$ , then $\sinh(x)$ should return $-\infty$. 
\end{itemize}

This is true in all rounding modes.

Concerning denormals, $\cosh(x) \geq 1$, so $\cosh(x)$ can't return
denormal numbers, even for denormal inputs.  For small inputs ($|x|
\leq 2^{-40}$), we have $\sinh(x) = x$ with 80 bits of precision, so
we can return a result without any computation on denormals.

\section{Quick phase}

\subsection{Overview of the algorithm}

The algorithm consists of two argument reduction using classical formulaes of hyperbolic trigonometry, followed by a polynomial evaluation using a Taylor polynom of degree $6$ (for $\cosh$) and $7$ (for $\sinh$).

These formulaes are:
\begin{itemize}
\item  $\sinh(x + y) = sinh(x) * cosh(y) + sinh(y) * cosh(x)$
\item  $\cosh(x + y) = cosh(x) * cosh(y) + sinh(x) * sinh(y)$
\item  $cosh(k*ln(2)) = 2^{k-1} + 2^{-k-1}$
\item   $sinh(k*ln(2)) = 2^{k-1} - 2^{-k-1}$
\end{itemize}



After having treated special cases ($NaN$, $+\infty$, $-\infty$), we do a first range reduction, to have an small input x (between $\frac{-ln(2)}{2}$ and $\frac{ln(2)}{2}$).
So, we write $x = k*\ln(2) + y$, where k is given by rounding to the nearest integer $x * \frac{1}{ln(2)}$.
Now, $\frac{-ln(2)}{2} \leq y  \leq \frac{ln(2)}{2}$, but it is even too large to have a sufficient precision during polynomial evaluation with small polynoms, and we do a second range reduction, by writing $y = a + b$, where $a = index * 2^{-8}$ (index is an integer)  and $|b| \leq 2^{-9}$.

Mathematically, we have: $$\sinh(x) = (2^{k-1} + 2^{-k-1})*\sinh(y) + (2^{k-1} - 2^{-k-1}) * \cosh(y)$$
and
 $$\cosh(x) = (2^{k-1} + 2^{-k-1})*\cosh(y) + (2^{k-1} - 2^{-k-1}) * \sinh(y)$$
The second range reduction allows to compute $sinh(y)$ and $cosh(y)$ as $sinh(y) = sinh(a) * cosh(b) + sinh(b) * cosh(a)$ and $cosh(y) = cosh(a) * cosh(b) + sinh(a) * sinh(b)$. In the C code, we have $ch\_hi + ch\_lo = cosh(y)$ and $sh\_hi + sh\_lo = sinh(y)$.

A quick computation shows that $-89 \leq index \leq 89$, and we can pre-compute so few values of $sinh(a)$ and $cosh(a)$ and store them in a table as double doubles.


The constants $2^{k-1}$ and $2^{-k-1}$ are constructed by working directly on their hexadecimal representation.


$cosh(b)$ and $sinh(b)$ are computed with Taylor polynoms. It's well-known that $$cosh(b) = \sum_{n \geq 0}{\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!}}$$ and $$sinh(b) = \sum_{n \geq 0}{\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}}$$
For our needs, a degree $6$ polynom for cosh and a degree $7$ polynom for sinh give enough accuracy.

We write $\cosh(b) = 1 + tcb$ and $\sinh(b) = b *(1 + tsb)$, where
$$tcb = b^{2} * (\frac{1}{2} + b^{2} * (\frac{1}{24} + b^{2} * \frac{1}{720}))$$
$$tsb = b^{2} * (\frac{1}{6} + b^{2} * (\frac{1}{120} + b^{2} * \frac{1}{5040}))$$
We recognize the Horner scheme used for the evaluation of the polynoms, with all the coefficients being coded on doubles numbers.

If the input is too small (i.e. $|b| \leq 2^{-40}$), $tsb$ and $tcb$ are not calculated but directly set to $0$, to avoid any problem with denormalized numbers.


At this stage, we have computed all the needed sub-terms before the final reconstruction, which is done in two steps, corresponding to the two-step range-reduction. The reconstruction is computed in double-double arithmetic.
In the first reconstruction, some sub-terms can be ignored without any loss of precision, due to their very small relative values.
For this step, it exists a particular case, when $index = 0$, since it is the only case where $|sinh(a)| < 2^{-9}$ ($sinh(a) = 0$).
Now we have the definitive values of $cosh(y)$ and $sinh(y)$. 

In the second reconstruction, we begin by computing all needed products before adding their results (i.e. $2^{k-1}*cosh(y)$, $2^{k-1}*sinh(y)$,...). When $|k| \geq 35$, some terms can also be ignored, to increase speed. Computations are also done using double double arithmetics, with the Add22 function.

After this last step, we can do some tests to see whether the accurate phase using SCSLib is needed or not.


\subsection{Error analysis}

Many of the described computations can introduce a new term of error, so we must control them to obtain the final guaranteed precision.
\begin{itemize}
\item{First range reduction}
We have to consider two different cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item{$|x| \leq \frac{ln(2)}{2}$}

We have $k = 0$, and there is no reduction, and no term of error.
\item{$|x| > \frac{ln(2)}{2}$}

We have $k \neq 0$, and we must compute the term of error introduced by the range reduction.
Since $k$ is an integer, we can assume that there is no error on it. 
$ln(2)$ is a constant which is stored in the function in the double double format, and we have $ln(2) = ln2_{hi} + ln2_{lo} + \maxabserr{repr\_ln2}$, where $|\maxabserr{repr ln2}| \leq 1.94e-31$.
The total absolute error of this reduction is $\maxabserr{range\_reduc} = 3.437e-27$, so the maximum relative error is $\maxrelerr{range\_reduc} = 9.9e-27$ (we have $|x| \geq 0.36$), and that represents about $86.38$ bits of precision.

\end{itemize}

\item{Second range reduction}
This range reduction is exact (we only cut y in two parts, with no multiplication nor division), so no new term of error is introduced.

\item{Error in tabulation}
Since $cosh(a)$ and $sinh(a)$ are stored as double doubles, and since there are transcendental numbers (when $a \neq 0$), some error is done on their approximation.
A simple Maple procedure can compute this error, which about $\maxabserr{ca} = 6.08e-33$ for cosh and $\maxabserr{sa} = 1.47e-33$ for sinh. That is large overkill compared to precision on other values.
\item{Error in polynomial approximations}
We use the $errlist\_quickphase$ and $compute\_horner\_rounding\_error$ Maple procedures to compute thes errors on $tcb$ and $tsb$, which are $\maxabserr{rounding\_cosh} = 6.35e-22$ and $\maxabserr{rounding\_sinh} = 1.94e-22$. It exists an `mathematical'  error due to the polynomial approximation. The sum of theses errors gives $\maxabserr{tcb} = 6.35e-22$ and $\maxabserr{tsb} = 1.11e-21$.
\item{First reconstruction}
This reconstruction is done by adding all the pre-calculated terms ($tcb$, $tsb$, $ca = cosh(a)$, $sa = sinh(a)$), in an order which try to minimiza the total error.$\maxabserr{sh} = 2.10e-25$. Maple scripts are used to compute the error, since there are many terms.
There are 2 different cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item{$a = 0$}

$ch_{hi}+ch_{lo} = \widehat{cosh(\widehat{y})} + \abserr{cosh0}$, where $|\abserr{cosh0}| \leq \maxabserr{cosh0} = 6.35e-22$, and 
$sinh(y) = \widehat{sinh(\widehat{y})} + \abserr{sinh0}$, where $|\abserr{sinh0}| \leq  \maxabserr{sinh0} = 5.4e-20$.
\item{$a \neq 0$}

$ch_{hi}+ch_{lo} = \widehat{cosh(\widehat{y})} + \abserr{cosh1}$, where $|\abserr{cosh1}| \leq \maxabserr{cosh1} = 2.39e-20$, and 
$sinh(y) = \widehat{sinh(\widehat{y})} + \abserr{sinh1}$, where $|\abserr{sinh1}| \leq  \maxabserr{sinh1} = 1.09e-22$.
\end{itemize}

\item{Second reconstruction}
This reconstruction is based on multiplying the obtained results before adding them. The products are exact since each product has a factor which a power of 2. 
We have to leave absolute errors for relative errors, since the range of values returned by $cosh$ is to large. 
We will distinguish three different cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item{$|k| \leq 35$}
All terms must be computed. We have $ch_{hi} + ch_{lo} = \widehat{cosh(\widehat{x})}*(1+\relerr{ch})$, where $|\relerr{ch}| \leq \maxrelerr{ch} = 7.66e-19$
\item{$k > 35$}
In this case, some terms are negligible. We have $ch_{hi} + ch_{lo} = \widehat{cosh(\widehat{x})}*(1+\relerr{ch})$, where $|\relerr{ch}| \leq \maxrelerr{ch} = 7.69e-19$
\item{$k < -35$}
This case is symmetric to the previous one, we just have to remplace k by -k.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Details of computer program}

The procedures \texttt{cosh\_quick} and \texttt{sinh\_quick} contain the computation respectively shared by the 
functions \texttt{cosh\_rn}, \texttt{cosh\_ru}, \texttt{cosh\_rd} and \texttt{cosh\_rz} in one hand, and by the 
functions \texttt{sinh\_rn}, \texttt{sinh\_ru}, \texttt{sinh\_rd} and \texttt{sinh\_rz} in the other hand.
The eight functions \texttt{cosh\_rX} and \texttt{sinh\_rX} call \texttt{cosh\_quick} or \texttt{sinh\_quick} with an integer which represent the choosen rounding mode.
We will begin to prove the cosh function, and then we will prove the sinh function. Since both functions share a lot a code, only the different part between cosh and sinh will be proven for the sinh. 

\subsubsection{Exceptional cases and argument reduction}

This part  is shown for \texttt{cosh\_rn}, but it is quite identical for the three other functions.

  db_number absyh, absyl, u53, u;

\end{lstlisting}

Here there are all the variables which will be used in the code.

\subsubsection{First range reduction}

      temp_lo = -ln2_lo.d * k;                                          
      Add12Cond(b_hi, b_lo, temp_hi, temp_lo); 
    }
    else {                                                         
      b_hi = x;  b_lo = 0.;
    }                                                               
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Line 20 & Put in k the closest integer of x * inv\_ln\_2. \\
        & We use the property of DOUBLE2INT that convert a floating-point number in rouding to nearest mode. \\
        & By its definition, $k$ satisfies the following properties:\\
        &  $\lfloor x \times inv\_ln2 \rfloor \leq k \leq \lceil x \times inv\_ln2\rceil$ \\

        & we can apply the Sterbenz theorem to prove that the result of this line is exact\\

        & we can use the same reasoning and then apply the Sterbenz theorem\\
        & and this line of code is always exact. \\
Line 23 & this product is not exact, we can loose at most 11 bits of precision\\
        & there is an error of $\abserr{round}$ which satisfies $|\abserr{round}|\leq \maxabserr{round} = 3.15e-30$ on $ln2_{lo}$ \\
        & so a bound to the maximal absolute error is $k_{max} * \maxabserr{round}$\\
Line 24 & We do an Add12 to have well-aligned double doubles in $b_{hi}$ and $b_{lo}$\\
        & The conditionnal version is used since temp\_hi  can be zero if $x$ is very close to $k * ln(2)$.\\

Line 27 & We have $k = 0$. We needn't to do any reduction, so $b_{hi} + b_{lo} = x$ exactly.\\
\end{tabular}

At this stage, we have $b_{hi} + b_{lo} = \widehat{y} + \abserr{b}$, where $|\abserr{b}| \leq \maxabserr{b} = 3.43e-24$. Now we will write $y = a + b$, where $a = 2^{-8}* index$.

\subsection{Rounding}

\subsubsection{Rounding to the nearest}

The code for rounding is strictly identical to that of
Theorem~\ref{th:roundingRN1}.  The condition to this theorem that
$\mathtt{res\_hi}\ge 2^{-1022+53}$ is ensured by the image domain of
the $\cosh$, since $\cosh(x) \geq 1$. The rounding constant

\subsection{Directed rounding}
Here again, the code is strictly identical to that of
Theorem~\ref{th:roundingDirected}, and the conditions to this theorem
are ensured by the image domain of the cosh.

\section{Accurate phase}
For the accurate phase, we use SCSLib, which provides 208 bits of precision. That is a large overkill, since worst cases don't ask  more than 158 bits. Since an exp function already exists in crlibm, we can use it, by considering the following mathematic formulae : $cosh(x) = e^x + e^{-x}$.
\subsubsection{Polynomial evaluation - First reconstruction}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Procedure \texttt{cosh\_quick} - polynomial evaluation - first reconstruction},firstnumber=177]
  if ((k > -80) && (k < 80)) {
    exp_SC(exp_scs, x);

    scs_add(res_scs, exp_scs, exp_minus_scs);
    scs_div_2(res_scs);
  }
  else if (k >= 80) {
    exp_SC(res_scs, x);
    scs_div_2(res_scs);
  }
  else {
    exp_SC(res_scs, -x);
    scs_div_2(res_scs);
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Line 177   & We will distinguish three cases, since if $|x|$ is large enough, we can ignore some computations. \\
Line 178-181 & The used formulae is $cosh(x) = exp(x) + \frac{1}{exp(x)}$. \\
           & SCSlib ensure 208 bits of precision, so the final result has at least 158 bits of precision,\\
           & and that is enough for a correct rounding \\
Line 182   & If $|k| \geq 80$, $e^{-x}$ is negligible, since we have $e^{-x} \leq 2^{-160} e^x$. \\
           & So we continue to have our 158 bits of precision \\
Line 186   & This case is symetric to the previous one. \\

\section{Analysis of cosh performance}
\label{section:cosh_results}
The input numbers for the performance tests given here are random
positive double-precision numbers with a normal distribution on the
exponents. More precisely, we take random 63-bit integers and cast
them into double-precision numbers.  


In average, the second step is taken in 0.13\% of the calls.


\subsection{Speed}

\section{Conclusion and perspectives}

No cosh function exists in Ziv's libultim library, so the only quick hyperbolic cosine which was available for testing is in system libm. Our hyperbolic cosine is 30\% slower than this cosh, but this drawback is compensated by the fact that crlibm can ensure correct rounding, and 4 different rounding modes. System libm has only one rounding mode, and an average failure ratio of 42\%; most of the time only the last bit is false, but sometimes 11 or 12 bits can be false.
